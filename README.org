** Contributing
Contributions must be made from a branch of a fork of the repository. The branch should be named according to the standards outlined below. You also need to run a =dart analyze= on the project before committing changes, to be sure to follow style requirements.
Commit messages should be professional. We all get frustrated at times, but commits with messages like "Commas are dumb" will be rejected.
Never make a pull request that doesn't compile and run. These will also be rejected until they are fixed.
*** Branch Name Guidelines
Branches are named with a prefix, and a description. This makes it simple to understand the purpose of a branch when reviewing pull requests. A branch should only make one major change to the code base.

| Prefix   | Purpose                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
